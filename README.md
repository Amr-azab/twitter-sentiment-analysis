expressed in the form of tweets, can be positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment
analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of automatically determining
the sentiment expressed in a text, such as a tweet, as positive, negative, or neutral.
Sentiment analysis is a project that aims to analyze the sentiment (positive , negative
or natural ) expressed in text data.
